                <p class="cool">Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, is a fictional character from Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, he first appeared in "Tales of Suspense" #39 in 1963.

Tony is a billionaire industrialist and genius inventor, known for his charismatic personality and sharp wit. He inherits Stark Industries, a weapons manufacturing company, from his father. After being captured by terrorists and suffering serious injuries, he builds a powered suit of armor to escape, which leads him to become Iron Man.

As Iron Man, Tony struggles with his responsibilities, both as a superhero and a businessman. His character explores themes of redemption, innovation, and the consequences of technology. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he's portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., becoming one of the franchise's most iconic characters. Stark's journey features his evolution from a self-centered playboy to a self-sacrificing hero, ultimately playing a crucial role in the Avengers' efforts to protect the world.</p>
